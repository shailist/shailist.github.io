Hello there!

My name is Shai List.  
I'm a 22 years software developer.  
I really like programming for some reason.  
> I also like gaming and content creation but that's probably not why you are here.

From time to time, at work or at home, I run into some cool thing in code.  
So I set up this blog to share them with the world.

Feel free to contact me at my email or github :)
